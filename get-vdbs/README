The first version is very constrained:

1. Must be run from EAP_HOME/bin
2. Must be using standalone.xml
3. Copies all vdb deployments with a SHA to current directory with existing vdb name. 

The tweaks are easy, I just need to make time for it:)

*Note, if vdbs are file deployed/don't have a SHA, the script will output nothing
